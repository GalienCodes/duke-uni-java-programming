# Java-Programming-Principles-of-Software-Design


### After completing this course, you will be able to:
> 1. Use sorting appropriately in solving problems;

> 2. Develop classes that implement the Comparable interface;

> 3. Use timing data to analyze empirical performance;

> 4. Break problems into multiple classes, each with their own methods;

> 5. Determine if a class from the Java API can be used in solving a particular problem;

> 6. Implement programming solutions using multiple approaches and recognize tradeoffs;

> 7. Use object-oriented concepts including interfaces and abstract classes when developing programs;

> 8. Appropriately hide implementation decisions so they are not visible in public methods; and

> 9. Recognize the limitations of algorithms and Java programs in solving problems.

> 10. Recognize standard Java classes and idioms including exception-handling, static methods, java.net, and java.io packages.
